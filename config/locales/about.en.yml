    left_text: >
      <p><strong>Global Supplies</strong>
      is an informational website for food manufacturers, suppliers,
      exporters, importers, food distributors, wholesale buyers and food traders. It gives
      the ability to create personal profiles, publish products and requests, use
      communication and navigation tools, provide insurance, logistics and freight
      forwarding services. The product is a technical solution from JPC Commerce, a
      marketplace for wholesale food products in the local and international markets.
      The trademark is owned by the JPC Commerce Group holding with a separate
      autonomous organizational production structure.
      <br/><br/><strong>Key Partner</strong>
      JPC Commerce – The trading company based in Cyprus specializing in meat, egg
      and berry foodstuffs. <br/><br/>
      Working on the market since 2007. During this period, the company has
      established itself as a profitable counterparty, a reliable partner and a strong
      competitor.

    history: Global Supplies’ History
    year_2016: >
      The technical solution for communication, trading, financial and legal operations
      was successfully functioning in frames of JPC Commerce’s CRM. <br/><br/>
      The solution saves hundreds of man/hours, increased productivity, but had one
      huge drawback - its low bandwidth.<br/><br/>
      Each request had to be imported from many sources into the CRM where it was
      processed relatively quickly and exported through managers of different
      departments, with the uncontrolled interpretation of information, to potential
      partners.<br/><br/>
      The lack of a dominant digital ecosystem in the middle of the global B2B market
      has led to the idea of expanding the capacity of an existing technical solution by
      creating a new product accessible to all market participants.
    year_2018: >
      In March 2018, using the experience and expertise of a trading company to
      structure the partners&#39; visions and wishes, we published globsupplies.com
      marketplace for the first time. However, the lack of expertise in digital product
      development, high demand, and limitations in technology we selected have made
      our team face the need to find new technology partners and development
      scenarios.
    year_2019: >
      The successful selection of the developer team (<a href="https://beone.software" targe="_blank" >BeOne software</a>) and the loyalty
      of the users to the previous product provided a great creative resource in meeting
      the needs of the market.<br/><br/>
      We re-structured our partner values, used feedback from previous website users,
      and decomposed our product mission!<br/><br/>
      Thanks to the expertise of the trading company, the experience of the MVP 2018
      users, the knowledge and insight of the development team and the unbridled desire
      to help the industry, Global Supplies is today the world&#39;s first food product
      marketplace with the most intuitive, secure, wide and profitable functionality on
      the market.<br/><br/>
      We do not stop there, and day by day, we increase the number of categories and
      the quality of the website’s functionality!
